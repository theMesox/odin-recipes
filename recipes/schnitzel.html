    <h3>Description</h3>

    <p>Pork schnitzel is an easy recipe and it’s perfect for busy weeknights. The pork chops are pounded into thin, tender cutlets which are breaded and sautéed, resulting in a crispy crust and juicy center.</p>

    <p>You <em>must, must, must</em> serve these with lemon wedges. A squeeze of lemon juice adds a freshness and tang that is lip-smacking good!</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>

    <ul>
        <li>2 lbs boneless pork chops</li>
        <li>1/3 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1 Tbsp garlic salt (or sub with equal parts salt and garlic powder)</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp paprika</li>
        <li>1/2 tsp black pepper, freshly ground</li>
        <li>3 large eggs</li>
        <li>2 cups panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>Olive oil, canola oil or any high heat cooking oil to saute
        <br>
        Lemon wedges to serve (don’t skip the lemons!)</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>

    <ol>
        <li>Trim pork chops of fat and slice into 1/2″-thick cutlets. Line a cutting board with plastic wrap, place cutlets in a single layer on cutting board and cover with plastic wrap (this prevents splatter). Pound cutlets with a meat mallet or the back of a heavy saucepan, until 1/4″ to 1/8″ thick.</li>
        <li>Set up three bowls. In the first combine 1/3 cup flour, 1 Tbsp garlic salt, 1/2 tsp paprika and 1/2 tsp pepper. In the second, use a fork to beat 3 eggs. In the third bowl, add 2 cups panko crumbs.
        </li>
        <li>Dredge both sides of each pounded cutlet in flour then dip in beaten egg letting excess egg drip back into the bowl before breading in panko crumbs. It helps to use a fork for the dipping process to keep your hands clean. Repeat with remaining cutlets.</li>
        <li>Once all cutlets are breaded, heat a large non-stick pan over medium heat and add enough oil to cover the bottom of the pan. Once oil is hot, add breaded cutlets a few at a time and sauté 3-4 minutes per side or until cooked through. Reduce heat if cutlets are browning too quickly. Remove to a paper towel lined plate. Cut into one to double check doneness – juices should run clear. Serve right away with lemon wedges.</li>
    </ol>
