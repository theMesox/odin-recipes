    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>Hearty and comforting, this meaty, easy bolognese sauce recipe takes less time to make than it does to disappear into hungry tummies.</p>

    <p><strong>Ingredients:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tbsp olive oil</li>
        <li>1 cup grated carrots</li>
        <li>1 cup celery, minced</li>
        <li>1 cup onions, finely minced</li>
        <li>1 lb ground beef (80/20)</li>
        <li>1 lb ground pork</li>
        <li>1 25 oz jar store-bought marinara</li>
        <li>1/2 cup heavy cream</li>
        <li>1 lb wide pasta noodles, such as pappardelle or tagliatelle</li>
        <li>salt and pepper</li>
    </ul>

    <p><strong>Steps:</strong></p>
    <ol>
        <li>In a large saucepan heat olive oil over medium heat. Add in carrots along with celery and onions and sauté until they're just tender, about 3 minutes. Add the ground beef and ground pork, and cook until browned, breaking up the meat as you stir.</li>
        <li>Pour in the jar of store-bought marinara sauce along with salt and pepper and simmer for 30 minutes, stirring occasionally, until sauce thickens.</li>
        <li>When the Bolognese sauce has reached your desired consistency, stir in the heavy cream.</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, and serve over your favorite pasta—we like to use pappardelle or tagliatelle—and top with freshly grated parmesan cheese.</li>
    </ol>
